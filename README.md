## Magic Notes (The web app)

> This is a webpage created for taking notes/reminders on your local machine.

- Used vanilla javascript for adding functionality in my webpage.

  - Adding notes.
  - Deleting notes.
  - Searching/filter notes.

* I have used Bootstrap classes for the most of styling part.
